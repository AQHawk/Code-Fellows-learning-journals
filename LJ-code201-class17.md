# LJ Code 201 - Class 17

During our Dev Sprint, we finished knocking out the bulk of the site. We all feel comfortable with how it's coming along. We still need to create the writeups for each result and getting them to display on the results page...and I'm probably underestimating the time that will take. I believe that will be our main focus today.

We haven't had any issues working together on Github. One of our agreements was that we don't merge our own pull requests. It's worked out well so far.

I had to change out an image that I was using for the landing page. The image was disributed free for use as wallpaper, but I couldn't find any info on any other use. A search for that specific image has it spatterd all over the web, but they're mainly on Beachbody "Coaches" (Representatives) websites, so it's a safe assumption they have persmission from the company. I found a suitable replacement, but it has nothing to do with Beachbody. It works though.

All in all, the site is coming along great.
