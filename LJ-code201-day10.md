# LJ Code 201 - Day 10

I'm finding that the due times and dates are a little difficult to keep track of. I thought, on Friday, I had completed quiz 5 that was due last night, but, in reality had completed quiz 6 that isn't due until tomorrow.

I'm behind on the Salmon Cookies project and, because of that, I'm having anxiety about this coming week. I'm still having a difficult time with JS. I'm still trying to have faith with the process, but right now it feels like I'm just behind...and that's an extremely rare feeling for me. I don't like it.
