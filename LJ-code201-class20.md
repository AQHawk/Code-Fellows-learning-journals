# LJ Code 201 - Class 20

Wrapped up the day with some great presentations. Pizza and Jack on the menu made for a good ending to a tough course. Lookign forward to 301 with trepidation. Since I think I'm going to be taking the next 401 course that starts mid January, I might still have my commute for 301..unless I can find a room closer to Code Fellows for only a month.
