# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

I feel like something might have clicked today during pair programming. With help, I broke my code many times and was able to reconfigure in about 8 different ways...then put it all back the way it was originally with added function from the practice.

I still need to work question 7 more, but feel more confident than ever going forward with what I learned today.
