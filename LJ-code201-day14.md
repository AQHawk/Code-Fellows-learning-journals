# LJ Code 201 - Day 14

Today went better for sure. I'm only a little behind on this week's project, if I don't take into consideration styling. I was finally able to get the chart working near the end of the day, so no localStorage set yet. Resubmit coming soon.

My feelings of frustration seem to be shifting towards not having enough time in the day to do the things I need to do. Between my commute and my JS struggles and the other additional homework and quizzes, I'm not finding the time to style my pages. I'm also feeling a crunch, from being so far behind in last weeks assignment. I still don't have the form populating the table which is something I have to get working in the next couple of days. I need another set of eyes on it before the weekend, so I can work on the front facing index.html of Salmon Cookies. That resubmit dead line is just around the corner.
