# LJ Code 301 - Day 7

Not in a good place right now. I couldn't figure out one of two Kata's for the Code Wars assignment and, dispite turning in half the assignment correct, I got a big fat 0. Then, the form took much longer than anticipated, so I didn't get much sleep Sunday night.  The mobile challenge on Monday morning went horribly, but, then again, I didn't get much sleep the night before...another day at Code Fellows in a fog. I thought I was good at css until that assignment. I was rolling right along until I started working on blocks c and d and couldn't make them stack to the right of b. Multiple people looking at it, including Matt, and we struggled with it. Finally was able to get it to work - sort-of, -- despite using a reset.css and padding: 0 and margin: 0 around EVERYTHING there is still about 2 or 3 pixels to the bottom and right of c and d, so it's not stacking correctly within 960px. I've never fought so much with css. I'm thinking display: block or div's within section are causing the extra pixels..might need to set div's as articles instead.

..as an added kicker, I wasn't able to find a room closer to Code Fellows for a month for 301 and I didn't get much time off for the week in between, because I was finishing my internship - empoweredparenting.com. Now, we're moving into server side code, I still have a 3 hour a day commute and the Code Wars challenges just eat into more of my time and, I feel, have nothing to do with what we're trying to learn. I learn new concepts with Code Wars (like .every yesterday - wish I would have found that one a while back - or did I and forgot?), but, when my time is limited, I view Code Wars as a block/distraction to what I'm trying to focus on. Right now, I'm not convinced my move to Seattle to attend Code Fellows was the right choice for me.
