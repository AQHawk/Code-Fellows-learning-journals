# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

We worked with Objects today in a serious way. Talk about being thrown in the fire! What a day. I didn't learn objects in my college Python course until the next to the last week. Here we're on day 6. So crazy. I've learned more in the last week than in my entire Python course.
