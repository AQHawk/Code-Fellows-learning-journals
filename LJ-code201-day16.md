# LJ Code 201 - Day 16

We've started our plan for our final project. Clara didn't make it in on Friday and then on Sunday she told us she was dropping. I think it will go fine with Nick, Matt, amd myself.

If I make it through 201, I'm looking to rent a room near Code Fellows for 301 and 401?...question mark on 401 because I feel JS should be clicking for me more than it is at this point. It could be the lack of sleep and the 3 hours of commute time everyday. I have a love/hate with the labs. I find it hard to concentrate in that environment, but I think it's great that there's a TA to guide us in the right direction when we're stuck. The lack of sleep doesn't help my concentration either. During the week, in between 201(if I pass) and the start of 301, I plan on doing the Codecademy JS course as well as the jQuery precourse work. I feel like I need to refresh/organize my knowledge in a more linear way. Right now, when I think of JS it's spaghetti in my brain.
