# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Today was a little frustrating. Sam is super fast in the console and if something goes wrong while following along, you get left behind quickly. For me, I created this file in the wrong directory, then couldn't get it to move while still trying to follow, then I was prompted for my username and pass to push. I just had to stop what I was doing to absorb the lecture.

Then I had to take the quiz 4 times to get 100%. The correct answer for the next to the last question still doesn't make sense to me.
