# LJ Code 301 - Day 9

Yesterday, while reviewing the server side of things, I felt more at home. Although there are many connections to the blog, I get the relationships. I think next week will still be a challenge, though. Having to build the it from scratch won't e an easy task.

In ref to my last entry - I'm in a better place I suppose. I have a ton of homework and, unfortunately, I'm still dealing with my interneship "employer" and her site - but it's coming to a close after I emailed her that my obligation to her site will end soon after her most recent monthly updates request. I though it was understood, but I guess not..it needed to be stated. She's super busy and I haven't been able to hold a Team Viewer session with her to teach her how to manage her site, so I get it. Anyway, it's going to be a crappy weekend, so I won't feel like a caged animal stuck inside while taking care of things. The winter break is a much needed one at this point, though.
