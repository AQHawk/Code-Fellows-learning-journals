# LJ Code 201 - Class 19

We finished our project around mid morning, then proceeded to fix some bugs and styling issues.

Final presentations are today (Friday the 13th...duh duh duummmm). Should be fine, although we have a tough act to follow ~ The Template Generator. Joy is a savant when it comes to coding. She takes on new code and applies it like she's been doing it for years. I want to be her when I grow up.
