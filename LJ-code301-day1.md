# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

Day 1:

Crammed for time to get assignment completed before lecture at 2. First hour filled by course intro and presentation by Brandy. I didn't get to the code wars challenge. I think once the setup and getting used to more requirements for working in the terminla everything will go a bit quicker.
