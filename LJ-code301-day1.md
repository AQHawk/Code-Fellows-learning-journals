# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

Day 3:

Pair programming...ya. I'm on the fence right now about it. The success of it definitely lies in the partner. Small screen - hard to see - hard to navigate. If Driver = super fast typer, will drive without consideration of navigator = leads to ignoring navigator. Work gets done, but not for the benefit of both.
