# LJ Code 201 - Day 12

I feel a little better than I did from my weekend hell. Trying to find where my errors, when I see nothing wrong, is hard on a person's psyche.

I feel like this week might be a little easier on the brain than last week. I'm understanding JS a bit more, but, by no means, do I feel confident with it yet.

I can see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel though, so that's a good thing.

I'm actually looking forward to today. Sam, sometimes, talks over my level of knowlege of JS and that makes my mind explode. I'm understanding more of what he's saying now when he starts on a sentence that is nothing but terminology and nomenclature.

To wrap up, feeling better about this week. I was definitely reconsidering my options over the weekend, but after seeing that half the class was feeling the heat, as well, I'm ok.
