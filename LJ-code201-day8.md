# LJ Code 201 - Day 8

OK...kinda hating my life right now. There's not enough time in my day to tackle the workload...especially with my commute. I wasn't able to start today's lab, because I needed to refactor my code again using prototype...I believe it's because prototype allows for input, which is function I'll need for the form.

Here's praying tomorrow goes better than today.
